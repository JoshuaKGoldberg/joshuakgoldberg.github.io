What is the meaning of life?
42, of course!

What is your name?

I am become SimpleBot, destroyer of worlds.

Dude what.
Dude.

Dude!

Are you ready kids?
Aye aye captain!

I can't hear you!
AYE AYE CAPTAIN!!

Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?

Absorbent and yellow and porous is he
Spongebob Squarepants!

If nautical nonsense be something you wish
Spongebob Squarepants!

Then drop to the deck and flop like a fish!
Spongebob Squarepants!

If it's so simple, why haven't you done it already?
If you're good at something, never do it for free.

Where's Dent?
You have all these rules and you think they'll save you!

Joker-man, what you do with all your money?
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite, and gunpowder, and gasoline!

People are dying, Alfred. What would you have me do?
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it. They'll hate you for it, but that's the point of Batman, he can be the outcast. He can make the choice that no one else can make, the right choice.

Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should be aware of?
Oh, you have no idea.

Why's he running, Dad?
Because we have to chase him.

Because we have to chase him.
He didn't do anything wrong.

He didn't do anything wrong.
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A dark knight.

Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my boy here pull your head off.
How about a magic trick?

Tell your men they work for me now. This is my city.
They won't work for a freak!

So, let's put a couple tables together.
I'm not sure they'll let us.

I'm not sure they'll let us.
Oh, they should. I own the place.

Ask me a question.
So, what do you do?

Do you like it?
Well, it depends. Why?

Well, it depends. Why?
Well, most guys I know who are in Mergers and Acquisitions really don't like it.

Do you like Huey Lewis and The News?
They're OK.

Hey Halberstram.
Yes, Allen?

Yes, Allen?
Why are there copies of the style section all over the place, d-do you have a dog? A little chow or something?

Why are there copies of the style section all over the place, d-do you have a dog? A little chow or something?
No, Allen.

No, Allen.
Is that a rain coat?

Is that a rain coat?
Yes it is!

I'm on a diet.
What, you're kidding, right? You look great... so fit... and thin.

What, you're kidding, right? You look great... so fit... and thin.
Well, you can always be thinner... look better.

Well, you can always be thinner... look better.
Then maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I wouldn't want you to lose your willpower.

Then maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I wouldn't want you to lose your willpower.
That's okay. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.

You're inhuman.
No, I'm in touch with humanity.

New card. What do you think?
Whoa-ho. Very nice. Look at that.

Whoa-ho. Very nice. Look at that.
Picked them up from the printer's yesterday.

Picked them up from the printer's yesterday.
Good coloring.

Good coloring.
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.

Don't you want to know what I do?
No. No, not really.

You have a really nice place here, Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Well, actually, that's none of your business, Christie. But I can assure you, it certainly wasn't cheap.

Come on, Bryce. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about.
Like what?

Patrick, where did you get that overnight bag?
Jean Paul Gaultier.

Where are you going?
I am just leaving.

I am just leaving.
But where?

But where?
I have to return some videotapes.

Patrick? Is that you?
No Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.

Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff! I just bought it on my way here. You heard it?
Never. I mean I don't really like singers.

Never. I mean I don't really like singers.
Not a big music fan, huh?

Not a big music fan, huh?
No, I like music. Just they're... Huey's too black sounding for me.

I think, um, Evelyn that, uh, we've lost touch.
Why? What's wrong?

Thousands of roses and lots of chocolate truffles. Godiva, and oysters in the half-shell.
I'm trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer tape, but Evelyn, my supposed fiancée, keeps buzzing in my ear.

Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP, called simply Whitney Houston had 4 number one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie?
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You own a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?

It's hard to choose a favorite among so many great tracks, but "The Greatest Love of All" is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation, dignity. Its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves. Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message, crucial really. And it's beautifully stated on the album.

The world just opens up and swallows them.
Eerie. Very eerie.

Listen Patrick, can we talk?
You look... marvelous. There's nothing to say.

You hate that job anyway. I don't see why you don't just quit.
Because I want to fit in.

This is really a beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam. This place is hot, very hot.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.

Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
Yeah, well. You're late.

Yeah, well. You're late.
Hmmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime Jell-O.

Is that Ivana Trump over there? Jeez, Patrick, I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana be at Texarkana?

I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?

Do you feel that way?
No, not really.

And where did he go to school?
Don't you know all this?

Don't you know all this?
I just wanted to know if you know.

Will you call me before Easter?
Maybe.

What about the past?
We never really shared one.
