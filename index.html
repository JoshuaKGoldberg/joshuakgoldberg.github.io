            This is the of Joshua Kevin Goldberg, a member of the Class of 2015 at RPI majoring in Computer Science. That's me! I'm mainly interested in programming, algorithmic design, and the future of the web (among other things).
        </p>
        <p>
            This was made using Visual Studio 2013 and Photoshop CS6 on Windows 10. Haters gonna hate.
            <br /> I'm pretty platform agnostic; my most powerful languages are Javascript and C#. My <a href="https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg">GitHub</a> explains it better.

            Feedback regarding specific projects is best sent via those specific websites; you may reach me directly via my email, <a class="email">joshuakgoldberg@outlook.com</a>.
            <br /> I am not available for hire, but it's always a good idea to grab a copy of <a href="http://www.joshuakgoldberg.com/Resume.pdf">my resume</a>.
